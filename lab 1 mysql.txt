In 5 we have the ten apps more rated, which are more commonly known and maybe because of that they have more users too.
Although in 6 we have the ten apps best rated, they are not the apps that have more users and maybe the users consider them more useful for learning something they need or want to have in terms of knowledge than the apps in 5. The apps in 5 seems to be more related with freetime.

People seems to not care a lot about price because when we try the following query, the apps more rated are not the most cheaper. 
select track_name, price, rating_count_tot
from applestore 
order by price desc
limit 10;

The apps best rated are not the most expensive neither the most cheaper, as demonstrated by the result of this query:
select track_name, price, user_rating
from applestore
order by price desc
limit 10;
